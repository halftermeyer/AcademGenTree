# AcademGenTree

This is a python dirty web-scaping script that generates an academic genalogical tree (say a DAG). 

[The Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://www.genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu) is a service of the NDSU Department of Mathematics, in association with the American Mathematical Society.

My work isn't backed by them in any way.
